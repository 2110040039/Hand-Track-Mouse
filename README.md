# Hand Track Mouse

## Overview
**Hand Track Mouse** is a Python application that allows users to control the mouse cursor and simulate mouse clicks using hand gestures. The system is built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to track hand landmarks and map them to mouse functions.

## Features
- **Hand Gesture Detection**: Real-time detection of hand landmarks using the MediaPipe library.
- **Cursor Movement**: Control the mouse cursor using the index finger's movement.
- **Click Simulation**: Perform a left-click when the thumb and index finger come close together.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Can be run on both Windows and Linux.

## Future Enhancements
- **Right-Click Support**: Add gesture-based support for right-clicking.
- **Scrolling Functionality**: Use hand gestures for scrolling up and down.
- **Gesture Customization**: Allow users to customize gestures for different actions.
- **Multi-Finger Gestures**: Implement additional gestures using multiple fingers for advanced control.

## Use Cases
- **Hands-Free Navigation**: Use hand gestures to control the mouse without touching the keyboard or mouse.
- **Accessibility**: Improve accessibility for users who may have difficulty using traditional input devices.
- **Presentation Control**: Seamlessly control the cursor during presentations using gestures.
